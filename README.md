I used Windows 10 OS, python 3.7.5 and pyTelegramBotAPI 3.7.2 

It is a telegram bot which plays virtual dice role. It can replace your real dice.
Make sure that you downloaded pics and dicebot.py in the same directory.

First of all you need to sign up on Telegram and create a bot (how to do it you can easily find in the internet).
Copy the TOKEN, whic—Ä you will receive after creating a bot, and in dicebot.py file replace "REPLACE IT WITH YOUR TOKEN" with your token but leave the quotes.
Run your code and in chat with your bot write /start command.
